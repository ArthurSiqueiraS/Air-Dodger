## Objective
The game only ends when the plane hits an obstacle. You gain 150 score points for every wave survived, but they also get faster on each wave.

## Obstacles

### Brick Block

Avoid by flying above or beneath the block.

### Flying Fence

Avoid by flying above or beneath or turn your plane to go right through it.

## Items

### Wonder Wrench

Pick up the magical wrenches between the blocks to gain an extra 100 score points and temporarily shrink your plane so it can pass through empty spaces more easily.
