## Obstacles

### Brick Block
Avoid by flying above or beneath the block.

### Flying Fence
Avoid by flying above or beneath or turn your plane to go right through it.

## Items

### Wonder Wrench
Pick up the magical wrenches between the blocks to gain an extra 100 score points and temporarily shrink your plane so it can pass through empty spaces more easily.
